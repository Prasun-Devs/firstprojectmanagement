Using GitHub’s project management tools like milestones, issues, and project boards can improve team collaboration and organization. Milestones help set clear goals for the project, such as completing key features or preparing for a release. This gives the team a sense of direction. Issues break down tasks into manageable parts, making it easier to track bugs, features, or improvements. Labels (e.g., bug or enhancement) help prioritize tasks.

The project board provides a visual overview, with columns like To Do, In Progress, and Done, making it easy to see what everyone is working on. It also promotes accountability, as team members know who is responsible for what.

One challenge I expect is ensuring the board stays updated. If issues aren’t moved between columns or marked as complete, it can create confusion. Additionally, unclear tasks in issues may slow down progress. Regular check-ins and communication will be key to avoiding these issues.
